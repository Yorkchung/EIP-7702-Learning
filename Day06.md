# Persistent Delegation and Multi-chain Use

## 1. Moving from Single-use to Persistent Delegation

EIP-7702 originally introduced temporary code execution for EOAs that only lasts during a single transaction. Once the transaction ends, the EOA returns to its original, code-free state.

However, newer iterations support **persistent delegation**, where:
- The EOA’s code remains active after the transaction.
- The code stays until a new SetCode transaction overrides it.
- This transforms the EOA into a minimal, programmable smart account.

### Why it matters:
- It enables ongoing programmable behavior across multiple interactions.
- Useful for session-based delegation, like a DApp session or delegated trading bot.
- Users don’t need to re-sign authorization each time they want to act through a contract.

### Risks to consider:
- Longer-lived delegation increases exposure to exploits.
- If a user signs a malicious delegation, they might lose control permanently.
- Best practice includes using expiration logic and revocation tools.

## 2. Cross-chain Authorization with `chainId = 0`

Delegation signatures in EIP-7702 include a `chainId` field to specify the intended network. But if this field is set to `0`, the signature becomes **valid on any chain** that supports EIP-7702.

This introduces the concept of **cross-chain delegation**:
- A single signature can be used on multiple EVM-compatible chains.
- It allows shared logic between chains without re-signing.
- Especially useful in L2s, rollups, and multi-chain apps.

### Benefits:
- Enhances developer and user convenience across chains.
- Reduces friction for cross-chain onboarding or actions.

### Dangers:
- A delegation signed on one chain can be replayed on another with different context.
- If a contract behaves differently on other chains, it might result in asset loss.
- Wallets and frontends must clearly inform users when `chainId = 0` is used.

## 3. Smart Account Evolution: 4337, 7702, and Beyond

EIP-7702 is part of a broader account abstraction movement, alongside proposals like ERC-4337 and EIP-3074. Each approach has different trade-offs and use cases.

### What makes EIP-7702 unique:
- It requires no permanent contract deployment.
- The EOA address never changes.
- It supports both one-time delegation and persistent smart logic.
- The mechanism works at the protocol level without additional infrastructure like EntryPoint.

### When to use 7702:
- Ideal for light onboarding, such as gasless registration or NFT minting.
- Works well for wallets that don’t want to fully migrate to contract-based accounts.
- Enables plugin-like flexibility with PREP and modular delegation.

### How it compares to ERC-4337:
- 7702 is lightweight and minimal, good for fast integration and UX upgrades.
- 4337 is heavier, more flexible long-term, but requires bundlers and contract deployment.
- Developers might start with 7702 and later upgrade to 4337 if needed.

Persistent delegation and cross-chain support push EIP-7702 beyond a simple UX tool. It becomes a viable **infra-light alternative** to full-blown smart accounts, suitable for everyday users and modular integration.

EIP-7702’s design allows it to scale with the user — from signing a one-time gasless transaction to powering a secure, modular, and programmable smart account that persists across chains.
