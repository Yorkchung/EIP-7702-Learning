# Real-world EIP-7702 Application: Ambire Wallet

## 1. How Ambire integrates EIP-7702 into its wallet  
Ambire Wallet is one of the first wallets to support [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702), allowing users to temporarily convert their Externally Owned Account (EOA) into a smart account within a single transaction. Users don’t need to change addresses or deploy new smart contracts to perform logic such as token approvals, batch transfers, and conditional operations.  

**In essence:** Ambire leverages `setCode` to “make EOAs smart temporarily,” then returns them to normal immediately after the transaction.

## 2. Gasless transactions and ERC-20 fee payment  
Ambire enables gasless transactions using stablecoins like USDC or DAI, facilitated by a Paymaster contract. Users don’t need to hold ETH; they simply sign a transaction, and the Paymaster verifies and covers the gas fee.

**Execution Flow:**
- User signs an authorization under EIP-7702  
- Wallet sends a `setCode` transaction to execute smart logic (e.g., `transfer`)  
- Paymaster verifies and pays gas  
- Logic executes and code is cleared—account returns to a pure EOA

## 3. Temporary smart account logic with no address change  
One of EIP-7702’s biggest UX wins is: **"you remain yourself."**  
The wallet address never changes. The account doesn’t need to be replaced or migrated. Instead, Ambire enables logic injection that gives the EOA smart capabilities *only within that transaction*. Once it finishes, there’s no leftover contract data or state.

## 4. Batch execution and transaction simulation  
Ambire supports the following features, built on top of EIP-7702:
- **Batch execution:** approve + call; cross-contract actions combined into one tx  
- **Simulation:** the wallet previews transaction effects before submission, preventing scams or mistaken approvals  

These are all implemented using smart logic injected through `setCode`.

## 5. Recovery and session key support for secure UX  
Ambire was originally built as a smart account-native wallet, so it retains:
- **Email + Social Recovery**: Users can restore access via email if they lose devices  
- **Session Keys**: Enables time-limited or app-scoped authorizations, reducing the need for repeated signing during longer sessions
