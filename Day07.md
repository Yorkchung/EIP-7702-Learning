# Future of EIP-7702 and Modular Account Ecosystem

## 1. How EIP-7702 fits into ERC-6900 modular AA

ERC-6900 proposes a standard for modular smart accounts, where account behavior is built from composable and upgradeable modules.

EIP-7702 complements this idea by enabling EOAs to **temporarily or persistently delegate to contracts** that implement 6900-compatible modules. Instead of deploying a dedicated smart contract wallet, users can dynamically attach logic at runtime using `SetCode`.

This allows:
- Installing only the modules needed for a specific use case  
- Swapping modules between sessions or actions  
- Minimizing on-chain footprint while gaining programmable flexibility

EIP-7702 effectively acts as a **runtime module loader**, transforming a simple EOA into a programmable account on demand — an ideal interface to modular ecosystems like ERC-6900.

## 2. Delegation as Plug-in Logic

Under the PREP architecture, EIP-7702 delegation is not tied to a fixed contract. Instead, it becomes **pluggable logic**, like a runtime-installed browser extension.

### Why this matters:
- Users can flexibly change how their account behaves.
- Apps can delegate to domain-specific modules (e.g. NFT-only wallet, DeFi-only wallet).
- Developers can publish auditable modules to be adopted trustlessly.

A practical example of plug-in logic comes from [Smart EOA design by @colinlyguo](https://hackmd.io/@colinlyguo/SyAZWMmr1x), which describes the following features enabled via EIP-7702:

- **Social recovery** modules to restore access  
- **Batch transaction handlers** to group actions  
- **Gasless transaction modules** using delegation  
- **WebAuthn or BLS key verification** via custom signature logic  
- **Session keys** with scoped, time-limited permission

All of these capabilities can be modularized and injected at runtime via delegation, aligning with the 7702 plug-in execution model.

## 3. ZyFi’s Vision: Infra-light, User-first Abstraction

ZyFi presents EIP-7702 as the most **practical, low-friction entry point** into account abstraction — one that minimizes infrastructure changes and prioritizes user ownership.

### Key ideas:
- Users shouldn't be forced to migrate addresses or deploy new wallets.
- Smart account logic should be optional, composable, and easily revocable.
- Delegation should be short-lived, bounded, and transparent to the user.
- No need for new bundlers, new RPCs, or EntryPoint contracts.

This makes 7702 suitable for wallets that want to offer “smart account-like” UX (e.g., social recovery, batch tx, paymaster) **without** rebuilding everything.

ZyFi envisions a modular future where:
- Wallets offer “installable modules” through delegation.
- Delegation registries help manage module permissions and expiration.
- Smart EOAs evolve gradually, gaining programmable power step-by-step.
