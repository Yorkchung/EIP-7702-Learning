# Real-world EIP-7702: Privy and ZeroDev

## 1. Sign EIP-7702 authorizations with embedded wallets
Privy offers the `useSignAuthorization()` React hook, allowing users to sign this authorization directly with their embedded wallet — no MetaMask popup or manual config needed.

```tsx
import {useSignAuthorization} from '@privy-io/react-auth';

const {signAuthorization} = useSignAuthorization();

const authorization = signAuthorization({
  contractAddress: '0x12345...', // The address of the smart contract
  chainId: chain.id
});
```

**Why this matters:**  
- Stateless and lightweight authorization  
- Great for batch actions, delegated logic, or recovery use cases

## 2. Enable gasless transactions with Paymaster via ZeroDev  
Even though EOA can run smart logic in a 7702 transaction, they still need to pay gas. With ZeroDev’s infrastructure, you can let a **Paymaster sponsor the gas**, enabling **gasless transactions** for your users.

**What ZeroDev provides:**  
- Bundler RPC (to package & verify transactions)  
- Paymaster RPC (to cover gas fees)  
- Kernel account abstraction support  

**Flow:**
1. User signs EIP-7702 authorization  
2. App builds a `setCode` transaction  
3. Transaction is sent to the bundler + paymaster  
4. User pays no ETH, transaction succeeds

## 3. Configure custom wallet UI using PrivyProvider  
Privy allows you to hide the default wallet UI and design your own seamless front-end interactions:

```tsx
<PrivyProvider
  config={{
    embeddedWallets: {
      showWalletUIs: false,
      createOnLogin: 'all-users'
    }
  }}
>
  ...
</PrivyProvider>
```
#### This ensures:
- Every user gets an embedded wallet automatically
- You control how they sign, interact, and visualize their accounts
- Wallet is invisible unless needed

#### Result:
- Flexible UX, app-native experience
- Perfect for embedded wallets in games, communities, social apps

## 4. Create temporary smart accounts (7702 kernel) via SDK

Although EIP-7702 doesn’t require deploying a smart account, ZeroDev makes it easy to implement with their SDK:
- Instantiates a 7702 Kernel smart account
- Uses the embedded Privy wallet as signer
- Loads smart logic modules
- Works with bundler/paymaster infra seamlessly

#### Result:
- Batch transactions (e.g. approve + transfer) in a single atomic call
- No need to deploy or persist a smart contract wallet
